# Some points of the hierarchical methods of clusterization are considered

A set of points in the plane with several condensations is formed. For this goal the iris dataset is used. The agglomeration algorithm is applied to the received dataset until complete integration into one cluster. At each iteration, the quality of the current clustering is evaluated using the Silhouette metric. The graph for changing of the Silhouette metric is plotted. The partition corresponding to the best metric value is visualized. <br />

The plots are attached. <br />
